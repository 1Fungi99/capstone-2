<h1>RULES:</h1>
<p>Blackjack is played with one or more standard 52-card decks, with each denomination assigned a point value. The cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value. Kings, queens, and jacks are each worth 10, and aces may be used as either 1 or 11. The object for the player is to draw cards totaling closer to 21, without going over, than the dealer's cards.</p>

<p>The best total of all is a two-card 21, or a blackjack. However, if the dealer also has a two-card 21, the hand pushes, or ties, and you just get your original bet back. But if the dealer goes on to draw 21 in three or more cards, your blackjack is still a winner with its 3-2 payoff.</p>

<h1>Game Instructions:</h1>
<p>The premise of this game is to beat the dealer's value of cards in their hand with your own. Each card in the deck has a certain value associated to them.</p>
<p>The values are as follows: </p>

<ul>
<li>Ace = 1 or 11</li>
<li>King, Queen, Jack, or 10 = 10</li>
<li>9 = 9</li>
<li>8 = 8</li>
<li>7 = 7</li>
<li>6 = 6</li>
<li>5 = 5</li>
<li>4 = 4</li>
<li>3 = 3</li>
<li>2 = 2</li>
</ul>

<p>Dealer's hand will be hidden till the player has finished their turn. Players turn will include being dealt 2 cards. You will be allowed to `hit` for another card, adding that card's value to your total hand value. If the player or the dealer's hand's value surpasses a value of 21, that player will `bust` and all bets go to the dealer.</p>
