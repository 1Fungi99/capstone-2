<h1>The Problem Solving Framework : 'UPER'</h1>

- U = "Understand"
- P = "Plan"
- E = "Execute"
- R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
    Build a text based game with GUI in java with requirements set in the README
<h2>
    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>
Brainstorming ideas for the project.
 - Blackjack
 - D&D module

<h2>Blackjack</h2>

<h3>Need:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Deck class</li>
<li>Hand class</li>
<li>Card class</li>
<li>Dealer/game class</li>
<li>Dealer hand? class</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Executing the Plan</h2>

<h3>Deck Class</h3>

<p>
Deck class need to be able to
<ul>
<li>Create new deck(Constructor)</li>
<li>Display deck (Optional)</li>
<li>Shuffle</li>
<li>Deal Cards to both player and dealer</li>
</ul>

<h3>Hand Class/Dealer Hand</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add cards to hand by calling deck</li>
<li>Display hand</li>
<li>Get total value of hand</li>
<li>Check for initial blackjack</li>
</ul>

<h3>Card Class</h3>
<ul>
<li>Store card name and value (short name for gui)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>
    4. Reflection / Refactor
</h2>

<p>No inclusions of Lambda/streams due to the amount of refactoring needed and the time constraints did not allow for me to complete that requirement. Possibly could have made the app with lambda function as I went, rather than working without it.</p>
